HEALTHCARE CHATBOT

A comprehensive healthcare chatbot designed to facilitate preliminary medical diagnostics with an intuitive, secure, and user-friendly interface.

OVERVIEW:

This application leverages machine learning and a graphical user interface (GUI) to allow users to enter symptoms and receive preliminary health insights. Using a Random Forest classifier trained on medical data, the chatbot provides potential condition predictions, offering users valuable initial guidance on their symptoms.

KEY FEATURES:

Interactive GUI: Developed with tkinter, the application offers an easy-to-navigate, visually appealing interface for smooth user interactions.
Secure Authentication: Implements a robust login and registration system with stringent password validation to safeguard user data and privacy.
Symptom Analysis: Powered by a Random Forest classifier from sci-kit-learn, trained on healthcare data, to predict possible health conditions based on user-entered symptoms.
Text-to-Speech: Enhances accessibility with pyttsx3, converting responses to speech for a more interactive experience.
Data Processing: Utilizes pandas for efficient data handling and numpy for complex computations, ensuring smooth performance and accurate predictions.
Modular Architecture: Organized in a class-based structure, enabling easy maintenance, scalability, and integration of future features.
Session Management: Includes an "End Chat" feature for smooth session termination and preparation for new user interactions.

TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS:

Preprocessing: Data is preprocessed through label encoding and feature extraction to enhance model accuracy.
ML Model: Employs Random Forest for its high accuracy and reliability in classification tasks, making it suitable for medical data analysis.
Error Handling: Includes robust error handling and user input validation for improved security and reliability.
